# Dynamic Weather System

A comprehensive weather system for Foundry VTT with multiple climate types, weather events, and historical tracking.

## Overview

The **Dynamic Weather System** module offers a robust solution for managing weather in your Foundry VTT campaigns. It allows you to simulate dynamic weather conditions, including temperature, precipitation, wind, and special events, adapted to different climate types and seasons.

## Features

*   **Dynamic Weather Generation**: Generates daily weather conditions based on the active climate type, season, and day/night temperature variations.
*   **Multiple Climate Types**: Supports various climates such as Temperate, Tropical, Desert, Arctic, Mediterranean, Continental, Oceanic, Subtropical, Monsoon, and Steppe, each with its unique characteristics.
*   **Special Weather Events**: Includes events like thunderstorms, banestorms, blizzards, sandstorms, strong winds, and hurricanes, with configurable probabilities.
*   **Weather History**: Maintains a detailed record of generated weather, allowing you to view patterns and statistics over time.
*   **User Controls (GM)**:
    *   **Control Panel**: A dedicated interface to view current weather, advance the day, change the time of day, and send weather to chat.
    *   **Climate Selector**: Easily switch between different available climate types.
    *   **Probability Settings**: Adjust the chances of weather events occurring to customize the experience.
    *   **Import/Export History**: Save and load your world's weather history.
*   **Chat Integration**: Share current weather conditions with your players directly in the Foundry VTT chat.
*   **Visual Effects (Future)**: Prepared for future implementations of visual effects on the canvas to represent weather.
